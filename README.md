> Note: This README.md is just a simple version for the beginning of the project.

## Language

The main language of the repository is English.

## Branches

The repository has two branches: `main` and `develop`.

- `main`: The production code branch.
- `develop`: The develop code branch.

> Only [AitorMelero](https://github.com/AitorMelero) can use the `main` branch.

## Commits format

### Commit with title and description:

```shell
git commit -m "[Title]" -m "[Description]
```

### Commits Types

- **feat**: New features.
- **fix**: Bugs fixed.
- **style**: Code styling.
- **refactor**: Code refactoring.
- **test**: Code testing.
- **docs**: Project documentation.
- **chore**: Maintenance work (e.g., configuration files).
- **build**: Build tasks.

### Other rules

- Separate the title from the body of the message with a blank line.
- Remove unnecessary punctuation marks.
- Do not end the title with a period.
- Use capital letters at the beginning of the title and for each paragraph of the body of the message.
- Use the imperative mood in the title (e.g. "Correct error" and not "Corrected error").
- Use the body of the message to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
- Don't assume that the people who will review the code understand what the original problem was, be sure to add the necessary information.
- Don't think that your code explains itself.

### Commits example

```shell
git commit -m "feat: Add card description" -m "Now we can see the description of the cards"
```

```shell
git commit -m "chore: Change dev command" -m "I've changed the command to run the application in the package.json file"
```

```shell
git commit -m "test: Add card unit test" -m "I've added the unit tests for the Cards"
```

> The most important thing is that the commits allow everyone to understand what has been done.
